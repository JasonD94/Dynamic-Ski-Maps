# Ski Maps
Ski Maps makes it easy find the current ski conditions at several NH ski resorts.

The site will allow users to view the current conditions for the following Ski Resorts:
- Bretton Woods
- Cannon
- Cranmore
- Loon
- Pats Peak
- Waterville Valley

A demo of client side programming may be found at the following URL:

http://downing.io/Ski-Maps/

A demo of the full project (with back-end) will be found at the following URL:

http://aws.downing.io/Dynamic-Ski-Maps/

(this should end up being a custom domain at some point)

## Setup

Ski Maps is built using HTML5, along with various CSS / JS libraries.

On the front end, we're using
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/),
[jQuery Maphilight](https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight),
and [Image Map Resizer](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/image-map-resizer).

On the back end we're planning on just using
[Python](https://www.python.org/),
along with
[BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
which is a Python library for web scrapping.

We may consider using a combination of or some of:
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/),
[Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/),
and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Running web_scrap.py
To run the Python script, you will need to have Python3 and BeautifulSoup installed.

Install it by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-bs4
```
