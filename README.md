# Ski Maps
Ski Maps makes it easy find the current ski conditions at several NH ski resorts.

The site will allow users to view the current conditions for the following Ski Resorts:
- Bretton Woods
- Cannon
- Cranmore
- Loon
- Pats Peak
- Waterville Valley

A demo of client side programming may be found at the following URL:

A demo of the full project (with back-end) will be found at the following URL:

## Setup

Ski Maps is built using HTML5, along with Bootstrap on the front end and
Python for back-end data collection.

To run the Python script, you will need to have Python3 and BeautifulSoup installed.

[BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is a Python library
for web scrapping. Install it by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-bs4
```
