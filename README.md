# GUI II Project Repository
This Git Repository will contain all the code for our GUI II Project.

A demo of client side programming may be found at the following URL:

http://jasond94.github.io/Dynamic-Ski-Maps

and

http://downing.io/Dynamic-Ski-Maps/

A demo of the actual project will be hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, URL TBD.


Current files:
- web_scrap.py -> this file will contain all the necessary web scraping, currently only
one ski mountain actually works.
- index.html -> this is the demo of the client side web page.
- img/js/json -> used by the demo web page, CSS to be added later along with better JS.
